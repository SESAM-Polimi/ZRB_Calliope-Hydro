# ZRB_Calliope-Hydro
Repository of the Calliope Hydro Model of the Zambesi River Basin

## Overview
The model hosted in this repository consists in an integrated coupling between the energy modelling framework Calliope (For further details about Calliope, see: https://github.com/calliope-project), including the national loads and relative power generation technologies, and a hydrologic simulation model of the water surface evaporation and dependence of the hydro-power production from the storage level of the dams.

The two models are combined by an iterative process:
