# ZRB_Calliope-Hydro
Repository of the Calliope Hydro Model of the Zambesi River Basin

## Overview
The model hosted in this repository consists in an integrated coupling between the energy modelling framework Calliope (For further details about Calliope, see: https://github.com/calliope-project), specifically modelled to descrcibe multiple cascade water reservoirs hydro systems, including the national loads of the modelled countries and relative other power generation technologies, and a hydrologic simulation model of the water surface evaporation and dependence of the hydro-power production from the storage level of the dams.

The two models are combined by an iterative process:
